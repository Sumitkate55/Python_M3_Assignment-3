# Python_M3_Assignment-3
*Functions & Modules in Python*
This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of functions and modules, as required for Module 4 of the Python course. The tasks are designed to solidify understanding of defining and calling functions, as well as using external modules like math.


*Task 1: Factorial Calculation*

The factorial.py script includes a function named factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number. The function uses a loop to perform the calculation and returns the result.

The script prompts the user to enter a number, calls the factorial function, and prints the output in a user-friendly format, for example, "Factorial of 5 is: 120".


*Task 2: Using the Math Module*
The math_module.py script demonstrates how to use Python's built-in math module for common mathematical calculations. 

The program asks the user for a number and then uses functions from the math module to compute and display the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine of the number. The output is formatted to clearly show each calculated value.
